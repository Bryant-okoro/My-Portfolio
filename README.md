# Bryant Okoro, an eager member of the Cybersecurity world aspiring to reach the top! 
<h2>Professional Statement</h2>

I am Bryant Okoro. I am a motivated and adaptable Cybersecurity Analyst with a strong foundation in identifying vulnerabilities, mitigating risks, and safeguarding organizational assets, etc. With a background in the basics of cybersecurity, which i acquired through obtaining the Google CyberSecurity Certificate and a CompTIA Security+ certification, along with years of study at my current university, I possess hands-on experience using tools such as Wireshark, Splunk, TCP-dump, Suricata and Nessus to analyze threats and secure networks. I also possess valuable soft-skills which i attained from my 1 year and 2 months of work as a receptionist at GreenLand Suites Hotel.



I am passionate about leveraging my analytical and problem-solving skills to protect data and systems against evolving cyber threats. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can apply my knowledge, grow as a professional, and contribute to building robust security strategies that align with organizational goals.
Recently, I completed the Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity. The Google IT Support and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate have prepared me for industry-ready jobs. My ultimate goal is to become a Security Analyst. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, the ability to work under pressure , and communication skills to address and relate problems and emerging threats.

As of 2024/2025, I am preparing to take the Linux Foundation Certified Associate (LFCA), CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+ certifications.
